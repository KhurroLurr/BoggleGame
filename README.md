# BoggleGame
A recreation of Boggle created for the course COP 3330 during the Summer of 2015

This was a project that was created as part of the course Object Oriented Programming
during the summer of 2015. The code was created using NetBeans as established by the
professor.

The project in of itself is complete and should work normally with essentially no
bugs that were found at the time of completion.

It can be run in any way desired as the program itself does not take in any special
files.

Rules of Boggle can be found here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle).
